PathExplorer
============

A simple program to add, edit, and delete entries from your PATH.

Using this program should be pretty straight forward. Once it loads, you will be presented with a list of the current folders in your PATH. 

The 'Add Folder' button will bring up the select folder dialog.

To delete an entry, simply highlight it in the list and press the "Delete Folder" button.

To edit an entry, double-click on it in the list and it should allow you to edit it. If what you enter is not valid, it will appear with a red background.

Changes to the PATH will not be saved until you click the "Commit PATH Changes" button. This is so that incase you mess something up, you can simply exit the program or change what you had entered to reflect what you actually wanted. The changes are permanent. I am thinking about adding a simple backup/recover tool to minimize busted PATH variables. Let me know.

DUE TO THE NATURE OF THIS PROGRAM, YOU MUST RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR. THE PROGRAM WILL NOT SAVE IF YOU ARE NOT RUNNING AS ADMINISTRATOR.

Hope you enjoy.
